Key Best Practices Implemented:
1. Security

- Network Isolation: Separate networks for database and frontend
- No Direct Database Access: Only backend can access database
- Rate Limiting: API and auth endpoints protected
- Security Headers: XSS, CSRF, and content-type protection
- User Management: Non-root users in containers

2. Performance

- Multi-stage Builds: Smaller production images
- Caching: Nginx static asset caching
- Compression: Gzip compression enabled
- Connection Pooling: HTTP/1.1 keepalive connections

3. Reliability

- Health Checks: All services have proper health checks
- Graceful Restarts: unless-stopped restart policy
- Proper Dependencies: Services wait for healthy dependencies
- Circuit Breakers: Timeouts and retries configured

4. Monitoring & Observability

- Request IDs: Trace requests across services
- Structured Logging: JSON logs with correlation IDs
- Health Endpoints: /health, /ready, /ping
- Metrics Ready: Easy to add Prometheus metrics

5. Development Experience

- Hot Reloading: Works in development mode
- Environment Parity: Same setup for dev/prod
- Clear Separation: Frontend, backend, database isolation
- Easy Testing: Individual service testing possible

6. Scalability

- Horizontal Scaling: Easy to add more backend instances
- Load Balancing: Nginx upstream configuration
- Caching Layer: Redis for sessions/caching
- Database Connections: Connection pooling ready
